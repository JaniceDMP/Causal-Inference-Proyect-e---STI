This repository replicates the paper "Internet-accessed sexually transmitted infection (e-STI) testing and results service: A randomised, single-blind, controlled trial". 
The objective of the paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of an internet-accessed sexually transmitted infection (e-STI) testing and results service (SH:24) on the uptake of STI testing and the number of diagnosed and treated cases, through a single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted in London, UK.

### Research Question: 
Does e-STI testing1 increase access to testing in comparison with face-to-face services?
### Main Hypothesis: 
When STI is accessible throught the internet, people test of STDs at a higher rate.
